user.status

for user.status - extract every accepted problems, make a plot of how many problems i solved overall
add unsolved problems and their rating to another page. Make sorting options like -
ascending, descending order
searching from ___ elo to ___ elo, search by elo
search by tags +- dont really need it tho
make a dictionary with all problems that i solved and extract every information from there
AND OBVIOUSLY MAKE THAT THING WHY I STARTED ALL OF IT - count the numbers of solved problems for some elo, primarily 1400

dont really care about blogs, but maybe do some searching, filtering functionality

Also make jsonp as written in documentation in cf
